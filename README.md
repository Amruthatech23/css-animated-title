# css-animated-title

This is a fun and creative HTML/CSS project that animates a glowing, colorful, and emoji-decorated title. The name (in this case, "Amrutha") appears in the center with sparkles falling, rainbow glows, and dancing emojis.

## Tech Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 (animations, flexbox, shadows)
- Google Fonts

## What I Built

- A glowing animated title using pure HTML and CSS
- Rainbow glow effect using `@keyframes` and `text-shadow`
- Falling sparkles with random delays for a magical effect
- Emojis dancing around the text with animation
- A central container styled with borders and soft glowing shadows

## What I Learned

- How to use `@keyframes` to create animations in CSS
- How to layer elements with `z-index` and `position`
- Creating a rainbow glow effect with `text-shadow` animations
- Making objects like sparkles and emojis float and move
- Using Google Fonts to style text
- Structuring and styling
